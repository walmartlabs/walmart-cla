prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publiclyperform, sublicense
(including but not limited through multiple tiers of sublicensees), and
distribute all or any portion of Your Contribution(s) and such derivative works,
by any means or methods now known or later developed, and permit others to do
any or all of the foregoing.

to those patent claims licensable by You or your Affiliates that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If
any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that
entity under this WCA for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Assignment of Trademark.

To the extent a Contribution includes any Trademarks created by You for purposes

successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.

Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such
rights for your Contributions to Walmart, or that your employer has executed a

__b.__ You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation or
should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
submit it to Walmart separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete
details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but

horses, spyware, or other malicious code.

__f.__ You agree to notify us if You become aware of any circumstance which would

have signed the WCA.

written modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit Contributions on
