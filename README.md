Walmart Contributor License Agreement CLA

Overview

The Walmart CLA repository serves as the information provider
for anybody interested in contributing to open source software managed by
_Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”)_ or any of its affiliates.

Walmart manages numerous open source projects on GitHub organizations such as 
WalmartLabs](https://github.com/walmartlabs), 
OneOps(https://github.com/oneops), 
Electrode(https://github.com/electrode-io) and others, as well as on other code
hosting system.

Walmart retains and controls the copyright for all of these projects.
The mechanism to ensure this control is called Contribute License Agreement CLA.
A signed CLA is required from each contributor(contributors) to these
projects. Managers and owners for the specific repositories and projects are
required to ensure signed CLAs exist for all incoming contributions - usually in
the form of a pull request.

Usage

We use CLA assistant(https://cla-assistant.io/) to automatically verify any
pull request against a list of known contributors that have already signed the
CLA.

- Contributors(contributors)
- Repository Owners(repository-owners)
- Corporate CLAs(corporate-clas)
- Available Documents(available-documents)
- Contact Us(contact)

Contributors

There are essentially 3 different scenarios for contributors.

Walmart Employee or Contractor as Contributor

If you are a Walmart employee or contractor, you essentially already signed a
CLA as part of your on-boarding. Simply fill in the required details and indicate
that you are associated with Walmart in the last question.

Individual Contributor

If you are contributing as an individual, simply fill in the required details
and agree to the CLA.

Corporate Contributor

If you are contributing as an employee of another company or organization, you
need to ensure that a corporate CLA has been signed and submitted to us.

Then simply fill in the required details and indicate the company you are
associated with and that a corporate CLA is signed in the last question.

Repository Owners

If you are a repository owner and reviewing pull request you need to ensure that
the CLA was signed. The CLA assistant adds a check to each PR and verifies that.

You should not merge any changes without a passing CLA check.

Corporate CLAs

If you want to set up a corporate CLA with Walmart, please review the documents in
this repository (PDF or markdown format) and contact us as detailed below.

Available Documents

Markdown and PDF versions of the individual and corporate CLA can be found in
this repository for your record.

The CLA used with CLA assistant is an identical copy managed by the
[walmart-cla-admin](https://github.com/walmartlabs-cla-admin) user on GitHub in
a gist.
